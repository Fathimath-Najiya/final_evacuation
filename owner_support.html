            <h2>Registering New Buildings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Log in to your owner account on the application using your credentials.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the "Manage Buildings" or "List of Registered Buildings" section in the menu.</li>
                <li>Click on the "Register Building" button to start registering a new building to the system.</li>
                <li>Provide a floor plan of the building as a graph, indicating nodes for compartments and edges
                    with values based on factors such as distance between compartments, width of pathways, etc.</li>
                <li>Assign names or labels to each node (compartment) for easy identification and navigation.</li>
                <li>Define heuristic values for nodes, estimating the difficulty of reaching the goal node from each
                    node.</li>
                <li>Save the information to complete the registration process for the new building.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>Updating the existing building</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When updating building details such as node coordinates or heuristic values, you can use '#' as a placeholder in the input fields.</li>
                 <li>  Entering '#' in a field indicates that you want to preserve the existing value for that attribute and do not wish to update it.</li>
                <li>By using '#' strategically, you can selectively update only the attributes you want, leaving others unchanged.
                    For example, if you want to update the coordinate X of a node but keep the existing coordinate Y, enter '#' in the coordinate Y field.</li>
                <li>Use '#' to clearly communicate your intentions to the system when updating building graph data.
                    It helps in distinguishing between attributes that require updates and those that should remain as they are.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>Giving Alerts for Registered Buildings</h2>
            <p>If there is an emergency situation in one of your registered buildings and you need to alert occupants
                and authorities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access the "Emergency Alert" or "Trigger Alert" feature in the application dashboard.</li>
                <li>Select the building where the emergency is occurring from your registered buildings list.</li>
                <li>Confirm the alert trigger, and the application will notify registered users, security personnel,
                    and emergency responders about the situation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>Seeking Professional Help</h2>
            <p>For the most optimal usage of the application and to ensure effective emergency management:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult with professional emergency response experts to customize and optimize emergency protocols
                    for your buildings.</li>
                <li>Organize training sessions and drills for building occupants and staff to familiarize them with
                    emergency procedures and the use of the application.</li>
                <li>Regularly review and update building information, emergency contacts, and alert settings to maintain
                    readiness.</li>
            </ul>
