            <h2>Receiving Alerts for Registered Buildings</h2>
            <p>Once you have added buildings to your repository, you will automatically receive alerts and notifications
                for any emergencies detected in those buildings. Alerts may include fire alarms, evacuation notices,
                security breaches, or any other critical incidents based on the monitoring system integrated with the
                application.</p>
            <p>Ensure that your notification settings are enabled to receive alerts via email, SMS, push notifications,
                or in-app alerts.</p>

                <li>Go to the "Trigger Alert" or "Emergency Response" section and select the building where the
                    emergency is occurring from your registered buildings list.</li>

                    personnel, and emergency responders about the situation.</li>
